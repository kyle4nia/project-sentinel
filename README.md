Project Sentinel
Project Sentinel is a next-generation decentralized social network designed to empower users through reputation-based identity, robust content validation, and community-driven governance. Leveraging advanced blockchain technologies and privacy-preserving protocols, Project Sentinel offers a secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant platform for social interaction.

Overview
Project Sentinel addresses the pitfalls of centralized social media by combining:

Reputation-Based Identity: Users begin as low-level oracles and, through meaningful interactions, earn higher trust and validation within the system.

Decentralized Content Validation: Posts and interactions are cryptographically validated and anchored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.

Privacy and Security: With Zero Knowledge (ZK) powered identity verification and decentralized storage (via IPFS), users maintain full control over their data.

Community-Driven Governance: Decisions are made based on user reputation and oracle levels, ensuring that those with proven trust and influence steer platform policy.

Key Features
Oracle System: Users are assigned oracle levels from 0 (new) to 5 (elite), impacting their voting weight, validation capabilities, and influence on governance.

Decentralized Infrastructure:

Kaspa (KHeavyHash): Anchors user actions and reputation onto a secure blockchain.

Decentralized Computation (Flux): Provides the compute layer for data validation and governance.

Decentralized Storage (IPFS): Ensures censorship resistance and permanent data storage.

Social Layer (SHA-256): Secures social interactions and content verification.

Privacy-First Design: Optional ZK-powered identity verification enables privacy while ensuring trust.

Robust Governance: Reputation-driven community voting empowers users to shape policies and moderate content effectively.

How Project Sentinel Compares
Versus Mastodon
Mastodon operates on a federated model with decentralized instances and community-driven moderation, but it lacks a formal reputation system and cryptographic content validation.

Project Sentinel leverages a structured reputation system and trusted oracles to provide a unified, secure, and privacy-first social experience.

Versus Minds
Minds offers cryptocurrency rewards and decentralized elements but relies on a hybrid model with centralized aspects.

Project Sentinel is fully decentralized, employing a robust reputation framework and cryptographic validation for enhanced security and governance.

Versus Steemit
Steemit rewards content based on community votes on the Steem blockchain but lacks a formal identity and reputation mechanism.

Project Sentinel integrates reputation-based identity and validation, with governance and rewards directly linked to a user’s proven trust and influence.

Versus Akasha
Akasha emphasizes content ownership and censorship resistance on Ethereum, but it does not provide a comprehensive reputation or privacy-preserving system.

Project Sentinel goes further with a decentralized governance model, reputation-based oracle system, and ZK-powered privacy features.

Versus DTube
DTube is focused on decentralized video sharing with rewards based on community voting within a hybrid ecosystem.

Project Sentinel is a versatile decentralized social network that covers a wide range of social interactions, with a strong emphasis on reputation, content validation, and secure governance.

Versus Peepeth
Peepeth offers a decentralized platform on Ethereum for micro-blogging and public discourse but relies solely on community voting and token-based rewards.

Project Sentinel differentiates itself by integrating a detailed reputation system, decentralized content validation through trusted oracles, and comprehensive privacy features.

Architecture
The architecture of Project Sentinel is designed as a layered system:

Users as Oracles: Distributed around the platform with oracle levels (0 to 5) influencing their interactions.

Core Mechanisms:

Kaspa (KHeavyHash) anchors data and validates transactions.

Decentralized Computation (Flux) processes and verifies user interactions.

Decentralized Storage (IPFS) stores content permanently.

Social Layer (SHA-256) secures communication and interaction data.

Data Flow: User actions (posts, comments, interactions) influence reputation, trigger content validation, and lead to rewards and governance feedback—all of which are transparently recorded on the blockchain.

Refer to the accompanying diagram for a visual representation of these interactions and data flows.
